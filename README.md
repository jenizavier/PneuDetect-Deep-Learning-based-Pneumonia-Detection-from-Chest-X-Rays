# PneuDetect-Deep-Learning-based-Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Rays
PneuDetect is a deep learning-based project designed to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model classifies images into NORMAL and PNEUMONIA categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on a labeled dataset to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Features:
✅ Preprocessing and augmentation for better generalization
✅ Custom data generator for handling images in ZIP format
✅ TensorFlow/Keras deep learning model implementation
✅ Class balancing and weighted loss for improved performance
